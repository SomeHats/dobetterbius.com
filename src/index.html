        </h1>

        <p class="lead">Do Better Bi Us is a campaign to call out biphobia and bi-erasure and
          provide clarity on how the gay and straight communities can better support the bisexual
          community.</p>
        <p class="lead">It was started by activists Lois Shearing at the start of 2018. Currently,
          it has existed as a hashtag on twitter, appeared in articles, and even been one of the
          rallying cries used in the First Bi Float project, which organised the first bi pride
          float to ever appear in London Pride.</p>

        <h2>Why a manifesto?</h2>
        <p>The Do Better Bi Us manifesto aims to clearly lay out ways in which anyone can help to
          combat biphobia and bi-erasure. It offers practical steps that anyone can and should take
          in their daily life to make the world a better place for bisexual people. </p>
        <p>The bisexual community is facing many critical threats to our health, well-being and
          safety, including; higher rates of sexual violence, higher rates of mental illness, high
          rates of poverty, and lower coming out rates. The manifesto outlines how and why we need
          allies to help us combat these issues.</p>

        <h2>The manifesto</h2>
        <p>The bisexual community is currently facing many serious issues and threats to our
          existence, including; worse mental health statistics than gay or staight (monosexual)
          comunities, an increased likelihood of living in poverty or going hungry, and bisexual
          women (cis and trans) are more at risk of sexual violence than monosexual women.</p>

        <p>Double discrimination (discrimination from both heteronormative society and from within
          the rainbow community) and marginalisation are both at least partial causes of all these
          issues.</p>

        <p>To counter the discrimination and isolation the bisexual community experiences, we as
          representatives of the bisexual community, are putting forward these demands.</p>

        <p><strong>We demand funding for bi-specific resources.</strong> Including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Specific funding for the 61% - 75% of bisexual women who are survivors of rape and
            intimate partner violence</li>
          <li>Funding for training resources and materials specific to bisexual issues, especially
            in mental health, rape crisis, and survivor support services</li>
          <li>Funding for bisexual refugees, who are disproportionately affected by the
            government’s current LGBT+ refugee policy</li>
          <li>The seeking out and payment of bisexual people (especially trans bisexuals and
            bisexuals of colour) to create resources/articles/art/etc on themes of bisexuality by
            those in positions to do so</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We demand acknowledgement of bisexuality as its own distinct community, with
            unique needs.</strong> Including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Separating bisexuals from heterosexuals/homosexuals in research whenever possible</li>
          <li>Specifically including biphobia alongside homophobia/transphobia in codes of
            conduct/resources/discussion and all other relevant instances</li>
          <li>Acknowledging bisexual-specific issues, including double discrimination, in articles,
            publications, and resources on LGBT+ issues</li>
          <li>Acknowledging in all relevant discussions/articles/resources/books that bisexual
            people and bisexuality have always existed and been a part of LGBT+ culture, history,
            and struggles even before the popularisation of the term</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We demand the use of bi-inclusive language, especially from LGBT+ organisations
            and others claiming to represent the community.</strong> Including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Avoiding erasing bisexuality in your language by using phrases like ‘different-gender
            relationship/marriage/union’ and ‘same/similar-gender relationship/marriage/union’ in
            place of ‘straight/heterosexual’ relationship/marriage/union’ or ‘gay/lesbian
            relationship/marriage/union’.</li>
          <li>Avoiding using binary language like ‘gay or/and straight’ when you are referring to
            ‘heterosexual or/and non-heterosexual’</li>
          <li>Avoiding using ‘gay’ as an term to describe the whole LGBT+ community</li>
          <li>Never using terms like “gold-star lesbian/gay”, “at least bisexual, if not gay”, “has
            had gay/lesbian relations in the past but is not married to a [different gender
            partner]” - as these all infer bisexuality is less queer/valid than homosexuality</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We demand acknowledgement that bisexuality has always existed across communities
            of all genders, classes, races, and backgrounds.</strong> Including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Always using definitions of bisexuality put forward by reputable bisexual
            organisations/individuals such as;</li>
          <li>Attracted to two or more genders</li>
          <li>Attracted to similar and different genders</li>
          <li>Attraction beyond gender</li>
          <li>Acknowledging that bisexuality isn’t now and never has excluded people of non-binary
            genders</li>
          <li>Acknowledging that many trans and non-binary people identify as bisexual</li>
          <li>Acknowledging that many bisexual-identified people are also asexual</li>
          <li>Acknowledging that bisexual people in different-gender relationships/marriages are
            still part of the LGBT+ community and should be welcome at all LGBT+ events/spaces</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We demand real, actionable solidarity.</strong> Including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Calling out biphobia and bi-erasure when you come across them</li>
          <li>Reaching out to, and working with bisexual organisations/individuals to make your
            space/event/company/etc actually accessible, safe, and welcoming for bisexual people,
            especially, spaces/events/companies that represent the LGBT+ community</li>
          <li>Making sure to include bisexual people/bisexuality in all media about the LGBT+
            community</li>
          <li>Making sure bisexual people/bisexuality are fairly and positively represented at all
            Pride events</li>
          <li>Acknowledging bisexuality in all relevant discussions, but particularly in regards to
            bisexual celebrities/activists</li>
          <li>Calling out when bisexual people are held a higher standard of queerness, by being
            asked/demanded to prove our credentials/dating history</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, we demand respect for our identity, history, culture and solidarity in
          empowering and uplifting our community. We demand an end to biphobia, bi-erasure, and
          monosexism.</p>

        <p>Biphobia kills. You can help combat it.</p>
